NLP Tasks Collection (Jupyter Notebooks)

This repository contains a collection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks implemented using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.
Each notebook focuses on a specific real-world NLP problem, applying classic techniques and modern pretrained models.

The goal of this repo is learning-by-building: understanding NLP fundamentals while solving practical problems.

Tasks Overview
Task 1: Sentiment Analysis

Classifies text sentiment (e.g., positive / negative / neutral)

Common applications: product reviews, social media analysis

Techniques include text preprocessing, vectorization, and supervised learning

Task 2: News Category Classification

Automatically classifies news articles into categories (e.g., sports, politics, business)

Demonstrates multi-class text classification

Useful for content recommendation and news aggregation systems

Task 3: Fake News Detection

Identifies whether a news article is real or fake

Applies NLP preprocessing and classification models

Addresses misinformation detection — a critical real-world NLP use case

Task 4: Named Entity Recognition (NER) from News Articles

Extracts named entities such as:

Persons

Organizations

Locations

Uses NLP pipelines to analyze structured information from unstructured text

Commonly used in information extraction and knowledge graphs

Task 7: Text Summarization Using Pretrained Models

Automatically generates concise summaries from long text documents

Leverages pretrained transformer models

Demonstrates the power of transfer learning in NLP

Task 8: Resume Screening Using NLP

Analyzes resumes to extract relevant skills and information

Can be extended to match resumes with job descriptions

Practical application in HR automation and recruitment systems

Tools & Technologies
